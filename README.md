ðŸš€ Tourist Intelligence: Predicting Tourist Arrivals Using AI & ML

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project applies artificial intelligence and machine learning models to predict international tourist arrivals, using real-world data from 2022, 2023, and World Bank statistics. The aim is to forecast tourism trends and identify the top-visited countries in upcoming years.

ðŸ“Š Features

Data exploration of 203 countries

Handling missing data with imputation techniques (previous year values, KNN)

Model training and comparison across various algorithms

Analysis of top countries by predicted arrivals

Evaluation of model performance

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

ðŸ§  Skills Applied

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Predictive modeling

Regression techniques

Missing value imputation (manual & KNN)

Model performance analysis

Visualization of tourism data

ðŸ“‚ Project Components

Dataset: Includes arrival data for 2022, 2023, and predictions for 2024â€“2025

ML Models:

Linear Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

ðŸ“ˆ Model Insights

Simpler models performed surprisingly well

RNN models showed improvement in prediction accuracy

Quality of data had a direct effect on overall model performance

Top 5 & Top 10 countries were ranked by predicted tourist numbers

ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Add economic & tourism sector indicators

Integrate LSTM to enhance RNN models

Optimize models using Grid Search or Bayesian optimization

ðŸ“„ Notes
This project highlights the value of combining AI with public data to support decision-making in the tourism industry.
